    <h2>My hobby is to read books.I mainly read adventure, thriller and mystery books. I read such books as they are usually very interesting. They have lots of suspense and unexpected twists and turns. I also read books about mythology. Some of my favorite mythology books are written by Rick Riordan. They are also very interesting as they combine the mythological world and the real one almost perfectly.</h2>
